> To create a connection between two nodes, you use zmq_bind()  in one node and zmq_connect()  in the other. As a general rule of thumb, the node that does zmq_bind()  is a "server", sitting on a well-known network address, and the node which does zmq_connect()  is a "client", with unknown or arbitrary network addresses. Thus we say that we "bind a socket to an endpoint" and "connect a socket to an endpoint", the endpoint being that well-known network address.[要在两个节点之间创建连接，可以在一个节点中使用zmq_bind（），在另一个节点中使用zmq_connect（）。作为一般经验法则，执行zmq_bind（）的节点是一个“服务器”，位于一个众所周知的网络地址上，执行zmq_connect（）的节点是一个具有未知或任意网络地址的“客户机”。因此，我们说我们“将套接字绑定到端点”和“将套接字连接到端点”，端点就是众所周知的网络地址。]

Causes
The use of cocaine or an amphetamine with cigarettes can result in chain smoking.[2] Many people chain-smoke when drinking alcoholic beverages, because alcohol potentiates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to re-sensitization and hence inducing a craving.[3]

The extent to which chain smoking is driven by nicotine dependence has been studied. It does not seem that the amount of nicotine delivered is a significant factor, as the puff volume correlates poorly with the frequency of cigarette consumption.[4]

Clinical use
Chain-smoking is given as an example of excessive addictive behaviour in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.[5] It may be used as a form of aversion therapy for smokers who are unused to such heavy smoking, inducing them to give up altogether.[6]

Ventilation
Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) professionals claim that an airflow of about 1000 cubic feet (28.32 cubic meters) per minute per smoker is required to maintain satisfactory air quality when the smokers are chain smoking.[7] However, research confirms that current HVAC systems, while important for general air quality, cannot control exposure to secondhand smoke.[8]

> Our world has many superheroes. But they have the worst of all superpowers: invisibility. For example, the catadores, workers who collect recyclable materials for a living. Catadores **emerged from** social **inequality**, unemployment, and the **abundance of** solid waste from the **deficiency** of the waste collection system. Catadores provide a heavy, honest and essential work that benefits the entire population. **But they are not acknowledged for it(但是他们没有得到承认)**. Here in Brazil, they collect 90 percent of all the waste that's actually recycled.
> 
> Most of the catadores ++work independently++, ++picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices++. They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags, shopping carts, bicycles and carroças. Carroças are carts ++**built from**++ wood or metal and ++found in++ several streets in Brazil, ++**much like**++ **graffiti(涂鸦)** and street art. ++**And this is how I** first met these marginalized superheroes.++
> 
> I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social, environmental and political in nature. In 2007, ++I **took** my work **beyond** walls and **onto** the carroças++, as a new urban support for my message. ++**But at this time**++, giving voice to the catadores. ++By **adding**++ art and humor to the cause, it became more appealing, **which ++helped call++** attention to the catadores and improve their self-esteem. ++**And also**,++ they are famous now on the streets, on mass media and social.
> 
> **So, the thing is,** **I ==plunged into== this universe and have not stopped working ==since==（我投身于这个宇宙，从那时起就一直在工作）**. I ++**have painted**++ over 200 carroças in many cities **and have been invited to do** exhibitions and trips worldwide. ==**And then I realized that catadores, in their invisibility, are not exclusive to Brazil**==. I met them in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey **and even** ++**in** developed countries **such as**++ the United States and Japan. **And this was ++when++** I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it's a big challenge. And then, I created a collaborative movement called Pimp My Carroça -- (Laughter) -- which is a large crowdfunded event. Thank you. (Applause). So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças. Catadores are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare, like physicians, dentists, **podiatrists（足病医生）**, hair stylists, ++**massage therapists（按摩治疗师）**++ ==**and much more**==. **But also**, they also receive safety shirts, gloves, raincoats and eyeglasses to see **++in high-definition++ the city**, ==**while their carroças are renovated by our incredible volunteers**==. And then they receive safety items, too: reflective tapes, horns and mirrors. **Then, finally**, painted by a street artist and **++become part of part of this huge（成为这个巨大世界的一部分）++**, amazing mobile art exhibition.
> 
> Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. **++But to ==meet the demand== in other cities（但为了满足其他城市的需求）++**, **including outside of Brazil**, we have created Pimpx, which is inspired by TEDx, and it's a simplified, do-it-yourself, crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça. So now everybody can join.
> 
> In two years, over 170 catadores, 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 donors ++**have been involved in**++ the Pimp My Carroça movement, **++whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school++.**
> 
> So ++**catadores are leaving invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued**.++ Because of their pimped carroças, they **are able to** fight back to prejudice, increase their income and their interaction with society.
> 
> **So ++now++,** ++**I'd like to challenge you to**++ start looking at and acknowledging the catadores and other invisible superheroes from your city. **Try to see the world as one, without boundaries or frontiers**. ++**Believe it or not**++, there are ++over 20 million catadores worldwide++. **So ++next time++** you see one, **++recognize（祈使句）++** them as a vital part of our society. Muito obrigado, thank you. (Applause).

> So I get off the plane, and I come to TED. And I think, jeez, ++I'm in the middle of a room of successful people!++ So ++why don't I ask them what helped them succeed++, and ==pass it on== to kids?

> I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" 
> 
> See, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests -- it's that I had too many. In high school, I liked English and math and art and I built websites and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator. Maybe you've heard of us. 
> 
> This continued after high school, and at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in, become all-consumed, and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was, and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored. And usually I would try and persist anyway, because I had already devoted so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field. But eventually this sense of boredom, this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging anymore -- it would get to be too much. And I would have to let it go. 
> 
> But then I would become interested in something else, something totally unrelated, and I would dive into that, and become all-consumed, and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing," and then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored. And eventually, I would let it go. But then I would discover something new and totally different, and I would dive into that. 
> 
> This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons. The first was that I wasn't sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career. I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing, deny all of my other passions, and just resign myself to being bored. The other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal. I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything. I worried that I was afraid of commitment[承诺], or that I was scattered[分散的], or that I was self-sabotaging[自我毁灭], afraid of my own success. 
> 
> If you can relate to my story and to these feelings, I'd like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then. Ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things. I'll tell you where you learned it: you learned it from the culture. 
> We are first asked the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" when we're about five years old. And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age. 
> 
> It's considered an innocuous[无害的] question, posed to little kids to elicit[引出] cute replies, like, "I want to be an astronaut," or "I want to be a ballerina," or "I want to be a pirate." Insert Halloween costume here. 
> 
> But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms[形式] -- for instance, high school students might get asked what major they're going to pick in college. And at some point, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night. Why? 
> 
> See, while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be, it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be. In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't reply with 20 different things, though well-meaning[善意的] adults will likely chuckle[轻笑声] and be like, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist. You have to choose." 
> 
> This is Dr. Bob Childs --

> and he's a luthier and psychotherapist. And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor turned illustrator[插图画家], entrepreneur[企业家], teacher and creative director. But most kids don't hear about people like this. All they hear is that they're going to have to choose. But it's more than that. The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture. It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling, the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth, and you need to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it. 
> 
> But what if you're someone who isn't wired this way? What if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about, and many different things you want to do? Well, there is no room for someone like you in this framework. And so you might feel alone. You might feel like you don't have a purpose. And you might feel like there's something wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with you. What you are is a multipotentialite. 
> 
> A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits. It's a mouthful to say. It might help if you break it up into three parts: multi, potential, and ite. You can also use one of the other terms that connote[暗示] the same idea, such as polymath[博学者], the Renaissance[文艺复兴] person. Actually, during the Renaissance period, it was considered the ideal to be well-versed in multiple disciplines. Barbara Sher refers to us as "scanners." Use whichever term you like, or invent your own. I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community, we cannot agree on a single identity. 
> 
> It's easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction[痛苦] that you need to overcome. But what I've learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way. Here are three multipotentialite super powers. 
> 
> One: idea synthesis. That is, combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection. Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography[制图法], data visualization[形象化], travel, mathematics and design, when they founded Meshu. Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspire[地理灵感] jewelry. Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea not despite, but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences. Innovation happens at the intersections. That's where the new ideas come from. And multipotentialites, with all of their backgrounds, are able to access a lot of these points of intersection. 
> 
> The second multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning. When multipotentialites become interested in something, we go hard. We observe everything we can get our hands on. We're also used to being beginners, because we've been beginners so many times in the past, and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones. What's more, many skills are transferable across disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue, so we're rarely starting from scratch. 
> 
> Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler and freelance writer. As a child concert pianist, she honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory. Now, she's the fastest typist she knows. 
> 
> Before becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner. She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice, and this skill now helps her write compelling[引人入胜的,不可抗拒的] pitches to editors. It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to, even if you end up quitting. You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely, in a way that you couldn't have anticipated. 
> 
> The third multipotentialite superpower is adaptability; that is, the ability to morph into whatever you need to be in a given situation. Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director, sometimes a web designer, sometimes a Kickstarter consultant, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James Bond. 
> 
> He's valuable because he does good work. He's even more valuable because he can take on various roles, depending on his clients' needs. Fast Company magazine identified adaptability as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive[兴盛] in the 21st century. The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot[中心点] in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive. 
> 
> Idea synthesis[综合], rapid learning and adaptability: three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at, and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus. As a society, we have a vested[既定的] interest in encouraging multipotentialites to be themselves. We have a lot of complex, multidimensional problems in the world right now, and we need creative, out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them. 
> 
> Now, let's say that you are[让我们假设你], in your heart, a specialist. You came out of the womb[子宫，发源地] knowing you wanted to be a pediatric[小儿科的] neurosurgeon[神经外科医生]. Don't worry -- there's nothing wrong with you, either. 
> 
> In fact, some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together. The specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas, while the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project. It's a beautiful partnership. But we should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we're wired. And sadly, multipotentialites are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers. 
> 
> So with that said, if there is one thing you take away from this talk, I hope that it is this: embrace your inner wiring, whatever that may be. If you're a specialist at heart, then by all means, specialize. That is where you'll do your best work. But to the multipotentialites in the room, including those of you who may have just realized in the last 12 minutes that you are one -- 
> 
> to you I say: embrace your many passions. Follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes. Explore your intersections. Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic life. And perhaps more importantly -- multipotentialites, the world needs us.

**What the sugar coating on your cells is trying to tell you**
> This is a talk about sugar and cancer. I became interested in sugar when I was in college. Not this kind of sugar. It was the sugar that our biology professors taught us about ==in the context of[在...的背景下]== the coating of your cells. Maybe you didn't know that your cells are coated with sugar. And I didn't know that, either, until I took these courses in college, but ==back then[那时候]== -- and this was in, let's just call it the 1980s -- people didn't know much about why our cells are coated with sugar. And when ==I dug through my notes[我把笔记翻了一遍]==, what I noticed I had written down is that the sugar coating on our cells is like the sugar coating on a peanut M and M. And people thought the sugar coating on our cells was like a protective coating that somehow made our cells stronger or tougher. 
> 
> ==But we now know, many decades later==, that it's ==**much more** complicated== than that, and that the sugars on our cells are actually very complex. And if you could ==shrink yourself down[把你缩小]== to a little miniature[ˈmɪnətʃər]  airplane and fly right along the surface of your cells, ==it might look something like this== -- with geographical features. And now, the complex sugars are these trees and bushes -- ==weeping willows[垂柳]== that are swaying[摇摆] in the wind and moving with the waves. And when I started thinking about all these complex sugars that are like this foliage（树叶[ˈfoʊliɪdʒ]）  on our cells, it became one of the most interesting problems that I encountered as a biologist and also as a chemist. And so now we ==tend to== think about the sugars that are populating[居住于] the surface of our cells as a language. They have a lot of information stored in their complex structures. 
> 
> But what are they trying to tell us? I can tell you that we do know some information that comes from these sugars, and ==it's turned out already to be incredibly important in the world of medicine[事实证明它在医学界已经非常重要了]==. 
> 
> For example, one thing your sugars are telling us is your blood type. So your blood cells, your red blood cells, are coated with sugars, and the chemical structures of those sugars determine your blood type. So for example, I know that I am blood type O. How many people are also blood type O? Put your hands up. It's a pretty common one, ==so when so few hands go up==, ==either you're not paying attention or you don't know your blood type, and both of those are bad==. 
> 
> But for those of you who share the blood type O with me, ==what this means is that== we have this chemical structure on the surface of our blood cells: three simple sugars linked together to make a more complex sugar. ==And that==, ==by definition[根据定义]==, is blood type O. 
> 
> Now, how many people are blood type A? Right here. That means you have an enzyme酶[ˈenzaɪm]  in your cells that adds one more building block, that red sugar, to build a more complex structure. And how many people are blood type B? ==Quite a few[相当多]==. You have a slightly different enzyme than the A people, so you build a slightly different structure, and those of you that are AB have the enzyme from your mother, the other enzyme from your father, and now you make both of these structures in roughly equal proportions. ==And when this was figured out, which is now back in the previous century==, this ==enabled== one of the most important medical procedures in the world, ==which, of course, is== the blood transfusion. And ==by knowing== what your blood type is, we can make sure, if you ever need a transfusion, that your donor has the same blood type, so that your body doesn't see foreign sugars, which it wouldn't like and would certainly reject. 
> 
> What else are the sugars on the surface of your cells trying to tell us? Well, those sugars might be telling us that you have cancer. So a few decades ago, correlations began to emerge from the analysis of tumor tissue. And the typical scenario is a patient would have a tumor detected, and the tissue would be removed in a biopsy procedure and then sent down to a pathology lab where that tissue would be analyzed to look for chemical changes that might inform the oncologist about the best course of treatment. And what was discovered from studies like that is that the sugars have changed when the cell transforms from being healthy to being sick. And those correlations have come up again and again and again. But a big question in the field has been: Why? Why do cancers have different sugars? What's the importance of that? Why does it happen, and what can we do about it if it does turn out to be related to the disease process? 
> 
> So, one of the changes that we study is an increase in the density of a particular sugar that's called sialic acid. And I think this is going to be one of the most important sugars of our times, so I would encourage everybody to get familiar with this word. Sialic acid is not the kind of sugar that we eat. Those are different sugars. This is a kind of sugar that is actually found at certain levels on all of the cells in your body. It's actually quite common on your cells. But for some reason, cancer cells, at least in a successful, progressive disease, tend to have more sialic acid than a normal, healthy cell would have. And why? What does that mean? Well, what we've learned is that it has to do with your immune system. 
> 
> So let me tell you a little bit about the importance of your immune system in cancer. And this is something that's, I think, in the news a lot these days. You know, people are starting to become familiar with the term "cancer immune therapy." And some of you might even know people who are benefiting from these very new ways of treating cancer. What we now know is that your immune cells, which are the white blood cells coursing through your bloodstream, protect you on a daily basis from things gone bad -- including cancer. And so in this picture, those little green balls are your immune cells, and that big pink cell is a cancer cell. And these immune cells go around and taste all the cells in your body. That's their job. And most of the time, the cells taste OK. 
> 
> But once in a while, a cell might taste bad. Hopefully, that's the cancer cell, and when those immune cells get the bad taste, they launch an all-out strike and kill those cells. So we know that. We also know that if you can potentiate that tasting, if you can encourage those immune cells to actually take a big old bite out of a cancer cell, you get a better job protecting yourself from cancer every day and maybe even curing a cancer. And there are now a couple of drugs out there in the market that are used to treat cancer patients that act exactly by this process. They activate the immune system so that the immune system can be more vigorous in protecting us from cancer. 
> In fact, one of those drugs may well have spared President Jimmy Carter's life. Do you remember, President Carter had malignant melanoma that had metastasized to his brain, and that diagnosis is one that is usually accompanied by numbers like "months to live." But he was treated with one of these new immune-stimulating drugs, and now his melanoma appears to be in remission, which is remarkable, considering the situation only a few years ago. In fact, it's so remarkable that provocative statements like this one: "Cancer is having a penicillin moment," people are saying, with these new immune therapy drugs. I mean, that's an incredibly bold thing to say about a disease which we've been fighting for a long time and mostly losing the battle with. So this is very exciting. 
> 
> Now what does this have to do with sugars? Well, I'll tell you what we've learned. When an immune cell snuggles up against a cancer cell to take a taste, it's looking for signs of disease, and if it finds those signs, the cell gets activated and it launches a missile strike and kills the cell. But if that cancer cell has a dense forest of that sugar, sialic acid, well, it starts to taste pretty good. And there's a protein on immune cells that grabs the sialic acid, and if that protein gets held at that synapse between the immune cell and the cancer cell, it puts that immune cell to sleep. The sialic acids are telling the immune cell, "Hey, this cell's all right. Nothing to see here, move along. Look somewhere else." So in other words, as long as our cells are wearing a thick coat of sialic acid, they look fabulous, right? It's amazing. And what if you could strip off that coat and take that sugar away? Well, your immune system might be able to see that cancer cell for what it really is: something that needs to be destroyed. 
> 
> And so this is what we're doing in my lab. We're developing new medicines that are basically cell-surface lawnmowers -- molecules that go down to the surface of these cancer cells and just cut off those sialic acids, so that the immune system can reach its full potential in eliminating those cancer cells from our body. 
> 
> So in closing, let me just remind you again: your cells are coated with sugars. The sugars are telling cells around that cell whether the cell is good or bad. And that's important, because our immune system needs to leave the good cells alone. Otherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases. But once in a while, cancers get the ability to express these new sugars. And now that we understand how those sugars mesmerize the immune system, we can come up with new medicines to wake up those immune cells, tell them, "Ignore the sugars, eat the cell and have a delicious snack, on cancer."

## Helping others makes us happier — but ==it matters how we do it==
##### “My favorite thing about Elizabeth Dunn's talk is her discovery that being a better scientist and a more generous person comes from the same impulse: a willingness to question our own conclusions. Her research has completely changed how I think about giving and where I go looking for my own happiness. ==At its best==, this is what social psychology can offer us: not just a better understanding of ourselves, but also a clearer sense of what we have to offer one another.”
> So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen a little ==frivolous[可笑的]==, especially at a time where we're being ==confronted== **with** some pretty depressing headlines[尤其是当我们面对一些令人沮丧的头条新闻时]. But it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key to solving some of the toughest problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade to figure this out. 
> 
> Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science" with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. 
> 
> I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster[平淡的] emotional response to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed that even toddlers[ˈtɑdlərz][学步的儿童]  exhibited joy from giving to others. 
> 
> In one experiment, my colleagues Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent[相等的] of gold, namely[也就是], Goldfish crackers[饼干]. 
> 
> We gave kids this windfall[意外之财] of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. 
> 
> (Video) Researcher: I found even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. 
> 
> Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. 
> 
> Researcher: But, you know, I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? 
> 
> Toddler: Yeah. Researcher: Yeah? 
> 
> Toddler: Yeah. Here. 
> 
> Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. 
> 
> Toddler: All gone, he ate it. 
> 
> Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them our hypotheses[haɪˈpɑθəˌsiz][猜想]. The data revealed that toddlers were pretty happy when they got this pile of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give some of their Goldfish away. 
> 
> And this warm glow of giving persists into adulthood. When we analyze surveys from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third of the world's population reported giving at least some money to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every major region of the world, people who gave money to charity were happier than those who did not, even after ==taking into account[考虑到]== their own personal financial situation. And this correlation[相互关系] wasn't trivial[不重要的]. It looked like giving to charity made about the same difference for happiness as having twice as much income. 
> 
> Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving might be one of those behaviors. 
> 
> I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. 
> 
> Yeah. At tax time, I found myself seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. 
> 
> Despite building my career by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. 
> 
> Around that time, devastating stories about the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. 
> 
> That's when I learned about the Group of Five. The Canadian government allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned and assembled furniture. 
> 
> When the big day came, we filled their fridge with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. 
> 
> When you hear that more than 5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took to help them be happy. 
> 
> This experience made me think a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. 
> 
> For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net to protect a child from malaria. 
> 
> We saw that the more money people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional return on investment was completely eliminated when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars are going to make a difference. 
> 
> Of course, the Group of Five program takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day, my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. 
> 
> Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations have offered to help, providing everything from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits of riding without training wheels. 
> 
> Then I remembered that he was four and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels, I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. 
> 
> (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! 
> 
> Kid: I'm gonna try. 
> 
> ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! 
> 
> (Squealing) Look at you go! You're doing it all by yourself! 
> 
> ED: So this is the kind of helping that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens to sponsor refugees. 
> 
> It's pretty great. 
> 
> Now Australia and the UK are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. 
> 
> Creating these kinds of meaningful connections between individuals provides an opportunity to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me that when he was a kid and his parents drove through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors of a local restaurant and invite this community inside to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches for this community in the days that follow. 
> 
> But the benefits of this program extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience, one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact as he passes familiar faces.
